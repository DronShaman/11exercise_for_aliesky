# In a given company, its employees are evaluated at the end of each year. The points
# they can obtain in the evaluation start at 0.0 and can increase, resulting in better
# benefits. The points that employees can achieve can be 0.0, 0.4, 0.6 or more, but
# not intermediate values between the above-mentioned figures. Below is a table with
# the levels corresponding to each score. The amount of money earned at each level
# is â‚¬2400 multiplied by the score of the level.

# Write a program that reads the user's score and indicates the user's performance
# level, as well as the amount of money the user will receive.
